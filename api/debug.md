Sure! Let's tackle a math problem together. 

**Question:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 
3x + 7 = 22 
\]

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Isolate the term with \( x \)**:
   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7 
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   3x = 15 
   \]

2. **Divide by 3 to solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{15}{3} 
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   x = 5 
   \]

So, the solution to the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \) is:
\[
x = 5
\] 

If you have another question or need a different type of problem, feel free to ask!Sure! Here's a math question for you:

**Question:**  
What is the solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)?

**Solution:**  

1. Start with the original equation:  
   \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)

2. Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \( 3x = 20 - 5 \)  
   \( 3x = 15 \)

3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):  
   \( x = \frac{15}{3} \)  
   \( x = 5 \)

So the solution to the equation is \( x = 5 \).
