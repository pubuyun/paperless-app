   - **AO2:** Analysis of how writers create meanings and effects.
   - **AO3:** Express informed, personal responses to literary texts using appropriate terminology and coherent, accurate writing.
3. For each AO, provide the following:

   - A score out of 10.
   - List strengths observed in the student's essay.
   - Identify areas for improvement with specific examples.
   - Suggest changes or revisions that could enhance their essay.
4. Calculate an overall grade scaled to a mark out of 30, determining which band the mark fits into (starting points detailed in the rubric).
