**Essay Title:** *How does Priestley present selfishness and its effects in An Inspector Calls?*

  

**AO1 (Theme/Context Analysis)**

- **Strengths:**

- The opening statement clearly sets the tone for the essay, establishing a strong understanding of the theme of selfishness, particularly in the context of the Birling family's worldview.

- Paragraph 1 effectively links the adjective “pink” to the concept of a ‘rose-tinted’ perspective on life, demonstrating an engagement with the theme of detachment from reality (line 4).

- The analysis of the Inspector’s arrival and the subsequent change in lighting effectively illustrates how selfishness impacts the characters’ ability to confront moral truths (line 8).

  

- **Improvements:**

- While the essay discusses the consequences of selfishness, it could deepen the exploration of societal implications by explicitly connecting the Birlings’ actions to wider themes of class and community. For instance, mention how their selfishness mirrors societal greed (insert explicit connection in paragraph 2).

- The metaphor “we are members of one body” could benefit from explaining how this viewpoint contrasts with the capitalist mindset of the Birlings; incorporating specific contextual commentary would enhance the analysis (in paragraph 3, cite contextual events post-World War II).

  

- **Mark:** 9/12

  

**AO2 (Writer’s Methods)**

- **Strengths:**

- The description of the lighting change (“brighter and harder”) effectively conveys the Inspector’s role in exposing the family's ignorance, showcasing strong analysis of stagecraft (line 8).

- The essay highlights language choices, such as “wretched” to convey dehumanization of Eva Smith, demonstrating an understanding of how language creates emotional effect (line 12).

  

- **Improvements:**

- The essay could enhance its discussion of the metaphor regarding community by linking it back to the play’s structure or specific moments; for example, explaining how this metaphor is juxtaposed with the Birling family's dialogue throughout the text (paragraph 3).

- Although the term “portentous” is unpacked, there is potential to link this characterization of Birling to the larger thematic concerns regarding leadership and moral responsibility. Add an analysis of how this effects the audience's perception of him as a capitalist figure (paragraph 4).

  

- **Mark:** 10/12

  

**AO3 (Response/Writing)**

- **Strengths:**

- The essay maintains a formal academic tone and employs sophisticated vocabulary, like “rapacious” and “virulent”, which enhances the scholarly nature of the work.

- The references to historical contexts, such as World War II, enriches the analysis and demonstrates the writer's understanding of the play's reception and its socio-political implications (paragraph 3).

  

- **Improvements:**

- A few informal phrases like “almost supernatural figure” detract slightly from the formality; consider revising to convey a more analytical stance (line 18).

- The argument would be stronger with a clearer overall conclusion that reiterates how the analysis of selfishness ties back to Priestley’s overarching message, rather than leaving it to the reader’s inference (end of essay).

  

- **Mark:** 5/6

**Actionable Steps**

1. Add examples of modern British social conditions when discussing the Birlings in paragraph 2, such as post-war struggles.

2. Integrate a stronger summary of how the Inspector’s warnings connect to the capitalist critique in the conclusion.

3. Consider replacing informal phrases with analytical language for a more formal tone (e.g., revise “almost supernatural figure” to “an imposing moral authority”).
