### **Feedback**  
**Essay Title:** *How does Priestley present selfishness and its effects in An Inspector Calls?*  

---

### **AO1 (Theme/Context Analysis)**  
**Strengths:**  
- **Paragraph 2:** Clear link between the Birlings’ “pink and intimate” home and their detachment from societal realities (AO1). The analysis of “rose-tinted spectacles” effectively ties the setting to their moral myopia.  
- **Paragraph 5:** Strong contextual awareness of post-1945 audiences’ lived experiences of war, aligning the Inspector’s warnings with Priestley’s socialist critique of capitalism (AO1/AO3).  

**Improvements:**  
- **Paragraph 4:** Mentioned the Inspector’s “fire and blood and anguish” but missed an explicit connection to the *context* of Priestley’s socialist agenda. Add: “Link this to Priestley’s desire for post-war societal reform to prevent repeated cycles of suffering.”  
- **Paragraph 1:** The introduction could contextualize the play’s 1912/1945 dual setting to frame the Birlings’ selfishness as a pre-war capitalist failing.  

**Mark:** 10/12

### **AO2 (Writer’s Methods)**  
**Strengths:**  
- **Paragraph 2:** Insightful analysis of lighting changes (“brighter and harder”) as a structural device to symbolise interrogation and moral awakening (AO2).  
- **Paragraph 3:** Effective exploration of the “one body” metaphor, linking it to collective responsibility and socialist ideals (AO2).  
- **Paragraph 6:** Nuanced examination of “portentous” and “portly” to critique Birling’s physical and moral gluttony (AO2).  

**Improvements:**  
- **Paragraph 4:** Identified the biblical allusion in “fire and blood” but did not analyse *how* the triadic structure amplifies the Inspector’s prophetic tone. Add: “The tricolon mirrors the inevitability of consequences, reinforcing Priestley’s warning.”  
- **Paragraph 2:** Mentioned “wretched girl” but overlooked the *grammatical choice* of “girl” (vs. “woman”) as a method to infantilise Eva and diminish her agency.  

**Mark:** 10/12

### **AO3 (Response/Writing)**  
**Strengths:**  
- **Paragraph 5:** Sophisticated terminology (“dramatic irony,” “prescient warning”) elevates the analysis and demonstrates a critical voice (AO3).  
- **Conclusion:** Clear alignment of the Inspector with Priestley’s socialist ideals, showing a personalised interpretation (AO3).  

**Improvements:**  
- **Paragraph 6:** Overused “multifaceted” as a descriptor; vary language (e.g., “polysemous,” “layered”) to strengthen lexical precision (AO3).  
- **Paragraph 1:** The thesis could be more *conceptualised* by framing selfishness as a systemic capitalist flaw rather than an individual trait.  

**Mark:** 5/6  

---

### **Evaluation**  
- **Overall Mark:** 25/30  
- **Band:** **Middle of Band 5** (21–25: “Thoughtful, developed analysis with secure understanding of contexts”).  
- **Rationale:** Strong AO2 analysis of methods and thoughtful AO1 contextual links, but lacks deeper exploration of Priestley’s political messaging as a *structural* critique (e.g., capitalism’s role in perpetuating selfishness).

### **WWW**  
✅ **Clear focus on stage directions and lighting** (e.g., “pink and intimate” to “brighter and harder”) to track the Birlings’ moral journey.  
✅ **Nuanced analysis of language** (e.g., “portentous” vs. “portly”) to critique Birling’s character.  
✅ **Contextual awareness** of post-war audiences’ perspectives, aligning the Inspector with Priestley’s socialist ideals.

### **EBI**  
⚠️ **Strengthen contextual framing** by explicitly connecting selfishness to Priestley’s critique of capitalism (e.g., Birling’s “profits” as a microcosm of pre-war exploitation).  
⚠️ **Deepen structural analysis** (e.g., how the play’s cyclical ending reinforces the consequences of unaddressed selfishness).  
⚠️ **Avoid repetition of ideas** (e.g., multiple references to the Birlings’ detachment could be condensed for sharper focus).

### **Actionable Steps**  
1. **Revise introduction** to include the 1912/1945 dual timeline, framing selfishness as a systemic issue Priestley critiques.  
2. **Add a paragraph** analysing the play’s structure (e.g., the Inspector’s exit and Gerald’s return) to show how selfishness persists without societal change.  
3. **Replace “multifaceted”** with terms like “polysemous” or “emblematic” in paragraph 6 to enhance lexical variety.  
4. **Connect “fire and blood and anguish”** to the play’s warning about repeating historical mistakes, using the 1945 context.
