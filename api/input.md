keep at like 1300-1500 words i guess

You find yourself in a place where you don't think you will ever be in, but it does not feel totally unfamiliar. It is, probably, very seldom that ordinary people like you landed this job.
A colonial office building, a hereditary business, a prestigious firm, you could say a haunted house judging from what is rumored, but no one knows what goes on inside,
but you think the air is unusually tense **...**
6 figures.

You look out the window as rain streaked it like tears on a mourner's face, blurring the skyline beyond Alamont & Bergmann's glass tower. The sense of foreboding that clung to the air. The moan that seeps through the seals. The wind's mournful cry.
You've been here for 2 weeks now, this is no congenial work, you shouldn't have expected that, expecting that was illogical.

You look down at your task, your pen hovered, trembling under its sheer heaviness.
You look around. You hear a suit being adjusted, a mug being gripped, and then a gentle sip. Today, you are visiting a client, a long term client, a high profile client, a high valuing client. Just for you. You, the new guy, the rookie. You stand up preparing to leave. Everyone glances up, looking at you, no warm greeting or good luck. Their glances steadied for just long enough then turned into grimaces mixed with lip biting. Then they returned to their work.

You get into your company car and drive to the client. You arrive at the foot of a hill. The rain suddenly stops. The engine coughs, sputters, and dies. Silence fills the car, broken only by you tightening your tie. You are left in the grey haze. 

The mansion looms ahead, a shadow against the storm. Mr. Bayer's estate. Your shoes sink into the path, as the hill’s air cold pressed up against your suit. The mansion’s facade sharpens: stone gargoyles perch on the eaves, their eyes hollow, mouths stretched wide. Ivy clings to the walls, tendrils thick as veins. The facade is perhaps made out of limestone, berated and dented as chemical rains rained.

You reach the door. It opens before you can knock and there was Mr. Bayer. You observe that he looks old, but stand straight, rigid, with purpose. You shake hands with him, his rough, patched hands gripping. firmly against your flimsy ones. You are lead through halls draped in darkness, furniture covered with blankets, portraits of stern-faced men as their eyes follow your steps. We pass rooms, doors ajar—beyond one, you see a flicker of light, a sharp smell of formaldehyde and something sweeter, like decay. You glance inside, a quick view was suffice: glass jars line the shelves, each holding a shape suspended in amber liquid. On the ground, you see multiple umbrellas lying open, their canopy stretched and stitched from pale, translucent material that gleams wetly. It can not be human skin. Beside it, a beaker bubbles, water swirling in a vortex, sand suspended in its center. All the other jars had rats in them, of varying sizes, varying bumps in their bodies, in various different environments. Dead rats, smelly rats, bulging rats, shrunk rats, lumped rats, alive rats, angry rats. You swallow, your throat dry.

You continue to the office, its door heavy with silence. My. Bayer goes to sit behind a mahogany desk, sleek, rectangular, the only piece of furniture that seemed to be up kept. 

His face sharp, he slides a file across the desk—Case 16-08. “This needs to disappear. Permanently. Your firm’s handled such things before.” His gaze pins me, like a collector’s pin through a butterfly’s wing, squishing you, and forcing you to comply and stay still. The butterflies in my stomach, followed suit. 
“The contents are… sensitive. A competitor’s formula, acquired through unconventional means. And there’s another matter. My associate, exposed to the chemicals—she’s gone now. It cannot surface. Any claims or motions related to these two needs to be settled or dealt with. I will pay the usual fee. Once its all good on your side, you can leave the rest to me."

You try to nod, but your mind reels back—two weeks ago, orientation. The senior paralegal’s voice, flat as a deposition transcript: “Billable target’s 1,800 hours. Partners track the logs.” Clara’s pen scratching, digging dirt from a plaintiff’s tax filings. Eddie’s cart creaking, his hymn. Miles Tanner’s grin, fading in his glass cage. Hargrove’s laugh, sharp as a blade. And the ledger—my name, scrawled in 2015, a decade ago. “Typo,” she’d said, but the ink seemed to bleed.

"Your cubicle is here. This is your in and out box, you will do the work in your in box and hand them in in your out box or directly to firm partners. You will do what you are told to. You will shred if asked to shred. You will come in after hours, overtime is not paid. You will not answer your phone if it rings past 6pm, let it roll to voicemail."
I nodded, but the air pressed down, heavy as a judge's gavel. 

We saw the mailroom, where Eddie sorted briefs under flickering fluorescents. His cart creaked, piled high, and he hummed a mournful tune. His limp was more pronounced today, he was respected, but he had fallen from a ladder. As he passed, he caught my eye and gave a small, bitter smile, his fingers drumming on the cart's handle.

The office sprawled like a labyrinth of cubicles, their walls scuffed and peeling at the seams, the hum of the vents a low growl that seemed to pulse with the building’s heartbeat.
Clara sat nearby, shoulders tense, eyes fixed on a deposition transcript. Her fingers struck the keys with furious intensity, the scratching sound echoing in the quiet office. She didn't glance my way, but I noticed the rosary beads wrapped around her wrist, the cross swaying with each movement. Her phone buzzed, and she glanced at the screen with a worried frown. Her voice was weary even from afar, but there was steel in her gaze despite its cracks.

Down the hall, Miles slumped in his chair, tie loose. His highlighter's tip wobbled, then followed the upper part of the body, the highlighter slipped, but it brought his hand down with it, streaking yellow across the desk. His eyes did not waver though, it stayed fixed on his screen, as if it drained his face pale. Fixed. You hear a highlighter being dropped onto the floor. He then slowly, started turning clockwise, head followed by shoulder. What was he turning for. You observer that the turn lasted for 4 seconds, there was nothing behind him. He turned, his body sagged.

Then, the senior suite. Victor Hargrove's door loomed, half-open, blackout shades slicing the light into jagged teeth. His laugh sliced through—a guillotine's edge, clean and cruel—while he paced, phone to ear, barking about a brief's misplaced semicolon. Fifty-eight, Armani-clad, his jaw sharp enough to cut glass, he was the firm's predator. His desk held a Christmas basket, it was February, a card pinned beneath: _"To loyalty."_  A specter from the '80s benzene case, still lingering and welcomed here after half a century.

As you turned back to your desk, you caught a glimpse of movement in the window's reflection—a tall, shadowy figure standing in your cubicle's doorway. But when you spun around, there was nothing. Yet, the presence lingered, a whisper at the edge of your mind, watching. A cold draft, a flicker in the corner of your vision. Eddie's hymn swelled.
That was orientation. She left you there, her voice trailing off: "Pace yourself. The clock's ticking."

You look at the document, your task two weeks later, today. It had no useful information, the file's edges were rounded and creased though, suggesting it was full before.
The shadow loomed closer, its edges sharpening as I gripped the document, and a faint rasp—like a dying breath—echoed from the vents.

Back in Bayers’s office, the air thickens. “You’ll handle it?” he asks, leaning forward, his shadow stretching long, swallowing the desk. I see the lab again, the umbrella’s pale canopy, the water swirling, the sand shifting in its jar. You remember what the shadow said, *Sign it, bury it, bill it*, and like hypnosis, your pen hovers, the words blurring. “Yes,” you say, the syllable spoken as light as a feather.

The lights flicker, die. Darkness floods the room, thick as ink. Bayer’s voice cuts through: “Choose wisely.” When the lights return, he’s gone. Two doors stand before me, identical, both ajar. You pick the left door and step through—and find myself outside, the two doors lead to the same spot. The rain starts to drizzle, the hill’s air warm. My car waits, engine purring, headlights piercing the mist. I slide in, grip the wheel, and glance back. Fog arose. You drive away, the road unfurling like a lie. 

In the rearview mirror, something shifts—a shadow in the backseat, or perhaps just my reflection, hollow-eyed, forever changed.  The rain resumes, harder now, drumming on the roof, and I press the gas, fleeing toward a dawn that may never come.
You remember seeing Eddie’s cart rattling past, his dreams buried within the documents; Clara’s rosary swinging, like a grandfather clock; Miles’s grin fading, a skull behind the glass. Hargrove’s laugh echoes down, sharp as a tool, and the ledger’s shadow stretches long, your name carved in its depths. 

That was fast, and short, you think. You don't hear, but feel the whisper now. Good job. Welcome to Alamont & Bergmann, do your job now.
