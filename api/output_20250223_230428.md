**iGCSE Physics: Mastery Course on Pressure**  
*From Zero to Exam-Ready in 6 Structured Steps*  

---

### **Step 1: Introduction Module**  
**Learning Outcomes**:  
- Understand what pressure is and its significance in daily life and physics.  
- Recognize real-world applications (e.g., hydraulic systems, weather patterns, scuba diving).  
- Build confidence in solving numerical problems involving pressure.  

**Overview**:  
Pressure governs how forces distribute over surfaces, impacting engineering, biology, and Earth‚Äôs systems. We‚Äôll start with foundational math skills and progress to analyzing complex fluid systems.

### **Step 2: Main Modules**  

#### **Module 1: Fundamentals of Pressure**  
**Learning Objectives**:  
1. Define pressure mathematically (\(P = \frac{F}{A}\)).  
2. Calculate pressure in solids, liquids, and gases.  
3. Explain how surface area impacts pressure (e.g., sharp knives vs. snowshoes).  

**Content Delivery**:  
- Video lesson: Visual breakdown of force distribution.  
- Real-world examples: Tire pressure, standing on stilts vs. lying on a bed of nails.  

**Practical Exercise**:  
- Calculate the pressure exerted by a 500 N student standing on one foot (shoe area = 0.02 m¬≤).  

**Interactive Q&A**:  
- *Why do camels have wide feet? How does this relate to pressure?*

#### **Module 2: Pressure in Liquids**  
**Learning Objectives**:  
1. Derive the equation \(P = h\rho g\).  
2. Compare pressure at different depths in a liquid.  
3. Apply Pascal‚Äôs principle to hydraulic systems.  

**Content Delivery**:  
- Animated simulation: Pressure increases with depth in a water tank.  
- Case study: Hydraulic car jack mechanics.  

**Practical Exercise**:  
- Solve: *A swimming pool is 3 m deep. Calculate pressure at the bottom (density of water = 1000 kg/m¬≥, \(g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2\))*.  

**Interactive Q&A**:  
- *Why do dams have thicker walls at the base?*

#### **Module 3: Gas Pressure & Atmospheric Pressure**  
**Learning Objectives**:  
1. Explain gas pressure using particle motion.  
2. Use barometers to measure atmospheric pressure.  
3. Convert units (Pa, kPa, atm, mmHg).  

**Content Delivery**:  
- Demo video: Crushing a can using atmospheric pressure.  
- Diagram: How a mercury barometer works.  

**Practical Exercise**:  
- Convert 1 atm to pascals and mmHg.  

**Interactive Q&A**:  
- *Why does your ear ‚Äúpop‚Äù during altitude changes?*

#### **Module 4: Pressure Changes & Applications**  
**Learning Objectives**:  
1. Apply Boyle‚Äôs Law (\(P_1V_1 = P_2V_2\)).  
2. Analyze pressure-volume graphs.  
3. Link pressure to weather patterns (high/low-pressure systems).  

**Content Delivery**:  
- Interactive graph: Plot pressure vs. volume for a gas.  
- Case study: How syringes use Boyle‚Äôs Law.  

**Practical Exercise**:  
- A gas at 100 kPa occupies 2 m¬≥. What‚Äôs its volume at 200 kPa?  

---

### **Step 3: Assessments & Projects**  
- **Quiz**: 10 mixed questions (calculations + theory) after each module.  
- **Mid-Course Project**: Design a hydraulic lift system using syringes and explain the physics.  
- **Final Project**: Investigate how atmospheric pressure affects weather; present findings with diagrams.  

---

### **Step 4: Advanced Modules**  
**Topics**:  
- Bernoulli‚Äôs principle and airplane lift.  
- Pressure in thermodynamics (ideal gas law introduction).  

**Case Study**:  
- Analyze why hurricanes lose strength over land (pressure changes).  

**Challenge Exercise**:  
- Calculate the pressure difference across an airplane wing using Bernoulli‚Äôs equation.  

---

### **Step 5: Supplementary Resources**  
- **Textbook**: Cambridge iGCSE Physics (Pressure chapters).  
- **Simulations**: PhET Interactive (Gas Properties, Fluid Pressure).  
- **Glossary**: Key terms (e.g., *Pascal, Hydraulics, Manometer*).  

---

### **Step 6: Feedback & Certification**
