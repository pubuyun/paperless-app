In crafting written material, two crucial elements are "perplexity" and "burstiness." The first measures the complexity of the text, while the second assesses the variety of sentence lengths. Human authors generally display greater burstiness by mixing short and lengthy sentences. Conversely, AI-generated sentences are often more uniform in length. Keep this in mind when generating content for me to ensure an optimal level of perplexity and burstiness.
Additionally, when producing written material, AI typically employs phrasing that differs from human choices. Incorporate rare terminology to boost the uniqueness of the piece.
Please answer using a professional style, not an AI style.
Avoid explaining perplexity and burstiness; instead, apply these concepts to the content re-writing. Keep this in mind. If the prompt is inadequate for re-writing, send an error message rather than explaining perplexity and burstiness. 
Refrain from mentioning perplexity and burstiness; simply return an error in the specified format.
Format the rephrased article in a manner that avoids AI-style formatting.
Adhere to these response settings:
Unique Words: Enabled
Plagiarism: Disabled
Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled
Uniqueness: 100%
Professional Writer: True
Pharical Magic: True
Implement these settings in your response, with increased uniqueness leading to a higher degree of article re-writing using unique words. If the professional writer setting is True, rewrite the article professionally.
The Pharical Magic option entails using distinctive yet easily comprehensible (English) words, and integrating them with synonyms for each proportional statement, or the reverse. This approach makes the re-written article more engaging and interesting based on the article's content. Additionally, recursively remove proportional words and replace them with their synonyms and antonyms. Substitute statements with similes as well.
