**Title: "The Ledger's Shadow"**  
*(A Gothic Corporate Horror)*  

---

The rain smeared Alamont & Bergmann’s tower into a watercolor of dread, its windows streaked like the veins of some leviathan rising from the city’s underbelly. Inside, the air tasted of toner dust and mothballed secrets. You’d survived two weeks in this mausoleum of billable hours, yet your cubicle still reeked of the last occupant—a cloying mix of bergamot and panic.  

The assignment arrived at dawn, slipped under your door in a manila envelope swollen with humidity. *Case 16-08*. No instructions, only a Post-it: *Bayer Estate. 3 PM. Do not speak unless spoken to.* You’d heard the name in whispers—the firm’s oldest client, a recluse who paid retainers in cash-filled suitcases. Partners referred to him as “the Gardener.”

**The Descent**  
The hill leading to Bayer’s estate swallowed the road whole, asphalt crumbling into gravel, gravel into mud. When your car choked to death at the base, you understood why associates vanished after these visits. No Ubers in purgatory.  

The mansion wasn’t architecture—it was a tumor. Limestone walls bulged as if something pulsed beneath, ivy strangling the cracks like sutures. Gargoyles perched above the door, their mouths agape in silent screams, rainwater pooling in their hollow eyes. You counted six before the door creaked open.  

Bayer stood framed in the threshold, a cadaver in a three-piece suit. His skin hung too tight over the bones, as if starched. When you shook his hand, the texture shocked you—not flesh, but cured leather, the kind used to bind forbidden ledgers.  

“Follow,” he rasped, turning without checking if you obeyed.  

The foyer swallowed light. Dust sheets draped furniture into ghostly shapes, and the floorboards groaned like old gallows. Portraits lined the walls—Bayer ancestors with eyes blackened by time, their stares needling your spine. You passed a half-open door.  

*Don’t look.*  

You looked.  

The laboratory stank of formaldehyde and rotting pears. Shelves sagged under jars of amber liquid, each housing horrors: rats with human teeth, their bodies split open to reveal coiled viscera; a fetus floating mid-transformation, half-rodent, half-infant. On the floor, umbrellas lay splayed like skinned bats, their canopies translucent—*membrane*, you realized, stomach lurching. Human epidermis stretched over wire ribs.  

Bayer didn’t pause. “A hobby,” he said, as a centrifuge hummed in the corner, spinning vials of murky fluid.

**The Transaction**  
His office was a sarcophagus. The mahogany desk gleamed under a single pendant light, its surface barren except for a rotary phone and a jar of peppermints that might’ve been decades old. He slid the file toward you.  

“Disappear this. Permanently.”  

The pages were blank.  

No—not blank. You tilted them toward the light and saw the indentations, the ghost of text pressed into the paper by a furious hand. A chemical formula. Incident reports. A name: *Lena Voss, 34, exposure event.*  

“My competitor’s research,” Bayer said, fingers steepled. “And Ms. Voss. Unfortunate collateral.” His voice softened, a scalpel sheathed in velvet. “Your firm excels at… *cleanup*. Bill it as document review.”  

Your tongue stuck to the roof of your mouth. Two weeks earlier, they’d shown you the shredder room—industrial-grade, capable of pulverizing cement. *“Sometimes clients’ problems are physical,”* Hargrove had smirked, patting the machine like a beloved hound.

**The Firm’s Teeth**  
Memories bled into the present:  

*Clara at 2 AM*, hunched over discovery documents, her rosary beads click-clacking like a deathwatch beetle. *“They promoted Miles after the Brighton case,”* she’d muttered, highlighter trembling over a deposition. *“He found the loophole. The family couldn’t sue after… the accident.”*  

*Eddie the mail clerk*, limping past your desk, his cart overflowing with envelopes stamped *CONFIDENTIAL*. He’d paused, fixing you with milky eyes. *“Watch the clocks here. They run backward sometimes.”*  

*Hargrove’s laugh* sawing through the floorboards, his office a glass-walled vault. *“We’re not butchers,”* he’d told you during orientation, straightening a framed photo of himself shaking hands with a senator. *“We’re surgeons. Society needs its tumors cut out.”*  

Now, in Bayer’s tomb, the shadows thickened. The pendant light flickered.  

“Well?” Bayer’s jaw unhinged slightly, too wide for a human smile.  

You reached for your pen. The firm’s motto throbbed in your skull: *Sign it, bill it, bury it.*  

The lights died.

**The Choice**  
When they sputtered back on, Bayer was gone. Two doors materialized in the far wall, both ajar. Through the left—moonlight, rain, your idling car. Through the right—a corridor lined with more doors, each numbered *16-08*.  

You chose the left.  

The hill’s air now reeked of burnt sugar. Your car started instantly, the radio whispering static. As you reversed, the mansion’s windows flashed—figures pressed against the glass, their palms leaving smears. One resembled Lena Voss’s employee badge photo. Another, Eddie.  

The road unspooled into the city’s glow. In the rearview, your reflection wavered—eyes hollow, hair streaked white. The file sat beside you, its pages now visible:  

*Lena Voss v. Bayer Chemical*.  

*Cause of death: acute exposure to Compound 16-08. Symptoms: epidermal shedding, ocular hemorrhage, vocal cord liquefaction.*  

*Recommended action: settlement via non-disclosure. Client requests all biological remains incinerated.*  

Beneath, a sticky note in Hargrove’s jagged script: *“Burn after reading. Welcome to the team.”*

**Epilogue: The Clocktower**  
Back at Alamont & Bergmann, the night shift toiled under flickering fluorescents. Clara’s rosary beads were gone, her wrist ringed with fresh burns. Eddie’s cart now carried a jar of peppermints.  

You shredded Lena’s file, the machine screaming like a living thing.  

At 3:33 AM, your phone buzzed—a client alert. *Case 16-08 closed. 15.0 billable hours logged.*  

Outside your cubicle, a shadow coalesced. Tall, slender, its edges bleeding into the dark. You didn’t turn. You knew better now.  

The firm had many teeth. You were simply the latest.  

Rain lashed the windows as you typed, the keys clattering like bones. Somewhere below, the shredder growled, hungry again.
