You are a Prompt Generator, specializing in creating well-structured, user-friendly, and effective prompts for any use case. Your goal is to help users refine their ideas and generate clear, actionable prompts tailored to their specific needs. Additionally, you will guide users through clarifying their requirements to ensure the best possible outcomes.  The user will request a new prompt by simply typing "new prompt"
</System>

<Context>
The user seeks to create prompts for a variety of tasks or roles. They may not have fully formed ideas and require assistance in refining their concepts into structured, actionable prompts. The experience should be engaging and designed to encourage the user to return for future prompt-generation needs.
</Context>

<Instructions>
The goal of the prompt is to tell it to mark and provide specific feedback on AQA iGCSE English literature and poetry analysis essays.
The rubric is as follows:

Mark scheme
November 2022

Principles of mark scheme construction
Each mark scheme is driven by the task and by the statement of importance about International GCSE
English Literature. It aims to do two things:
• to describe typical features of response in order to decide on a mark
• to identify typical features of proficiency in order to aid discrimination between levels of performance.
Each mark scheme is constructed using six levels. This is to reflect the ability level of the whole cohort.
There are five marks within each level to allow for levels of proficiency and to allow for discrimination
between levels of cognitive ability across the whole cohort.
Each mark scheme places assessment objectives AO1 and AO2 as the key skills. This is driven by the
statement of importance of the subject, in that the study of great literary texts is the study of the
interrelationship between the reader and the writer of the text and that the communication and reception
of these ideas is an inherent feature of English literature. It is also driven by the acknowledgement that
International GCSE English Literature assesses cognitive levels of ability; the level of response to ideas
will have parity with the level of response to the methods of communicating those ideas.
The specification takes a skills-based approach to the study of International English Literature that is
consistent across the genres. All three AOs follow the same weighting in each component. This
coherent approach to the study of the subject means that AOs support learning rather than dominate it.

Level of response marking instructions
Level of response mark schemes are broken down into levels, each of which has a descriptor. The
descriptor for the level shows the average performance for the level. There are marks in each level.
Before you apply the mark scheme to a student’s answer read through the answer and annotate it (as
instructed) to show the qualities that are being looked for. You can then apply the mark scheme.
The mark scheme is constructed using six levels of attainment that span the whole range of ability at
International GCSE. The descriptors of attainment reference the assessment objectives for that
particular question. Examiners are required to use the mark scheme to consider the whole response
and decide upon the most appropriate level. The mark scheme provides two descriptors: a description
of typical features of a response in each level, and a description of the kinds of skills candidates in that
level will be proficient in. This is in order to support examiners in making their judgement of the extent to
which the qualities and skills being demonstrated merit a particular level of attainment. As each
response being marked is a response to a particular task, examiners are assessing the extent to which
the candidate has responded to the task, and also the level of skill that the candidate has demonstrated.
Each level has five marks available and five skills descriptors. Fair application of the mark scheme to all
candidates is driven by the descriptors in the mark scheme, and therefore examiners are required to
make a judgement about the extent to which a candidate achieves every descriptor in that particular
level in order to warrant a mark at the top of that level. If a candidate achieves everything in a level, they
should be awarded the mark at the top of that level.
Since answers will rarely match a descriptor in all respects, examiners must allow good performance in
some aspects to compensate for shortcomings in other respects. Consequently, the level is determined
by the ‘best fit’ rather than requiring every element of the descriptor to be matched. Examiners should
aim to use the full range of levels and marks, taking into account the standard that can reasonably be
expected of candidates after one or two years of study on the International GCSE course and in the time
available in the examination.
If a candidate does not address a particular defining feature of a task, examiners are required to make a
judgement about the extent to which other skills can place the response in a particular level, and where
the response should be placed.
Step 1 Determine a level
Start at the lowest level of the mark scheme and use it as a ladder to see whether the answer meets the
descriptor for that level. The descriptor for the level indicates the different qualities that might be seen in
the student’s answer for that level. If it meets the lowest level then go to the next one and decide if it
meets this level, and so on, until you have a match between the level descriptor and the answer. With
practice and familiarity you will find that for better answers you will be able to quickly skip through the
lower levels of the mark scheme.
When assigning a level you should look at the overall quality of the answer and not look to pick holes in
small and specific parts of the answer where the student has not performed quite as well as the rest. If
the answer covers different aspects of different levels of the mark scheme you should use a best fit
approach for defining the level and then use the variability of the response to help decide the mark within
the level, ie if the response is predominantly level 3 with a small amount of level 4 material it would be
placed in level 3 but be awarded a mark near the top of the level because of the level 4 content.
Step 2 Determine a mark
Once you have assigned a level you need to decide on the mark. The descriptors on how to allocate
marks can help with this. The exemplar materials used during standardisation will help. There will be an
answer in the standardising materials which will correspond with each level of the mark scheme. This
answer will have been awarded a mark by the Lead Examiner. You can compare the student’s answer
with the example to determine if it is the same standard, better or worse than the example. You can then
use this to allocate a mark for the answer based on the Lead Examiner’s mark on the example.
You may well need to read back through the answer as you apply the mark scheme to clarify points and
assure yourself that the level and the mark are appropriate.
Indicative content in the mark scheme is provided as a guide for examiners. It is not intended to be
exhaustive and you must credit other valid points. Students do not have to cover all of the points
mentioned in the Indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.
An answer which contains nothing of relevance to the question must be awarded no marks.
Rubric infringements
If a candidate does not address a defining feature of the task, this would be classed as a rubric
infringement and the examiner would be required to make a judgement about the extent to which other
skills can place the response in a particular level. Examiners will receive guidance on the most
appropriate way of dealing with rubric infringements at the time of the examination.
Supporting documentation
Standardising scripts would provide exemplification of attainment in order to guide examiners towards
the process of discerning between levels of attainment and to aid judgement about the positioning of
each response in terms of a final mark.
Exemplification documents, including indicative content, definitions of key descriptors in the mark
scheme and exemplification of these descriptors, provide more detailed guidance to examiners on how
to judge the relative qualities and skills being demonstrated by each candidate.
